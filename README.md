## Bioinformatics in Rust

Welcome to **bioinformatics.rs**, your go-to hub for all things Rust in the world
of bioinformatics.
This site is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) and styled using the sleek
and minimal [PaperMod](https://github.com/cydave/zola-theme-papermod)theme to deliver
a fast, accessible, and user-friendly experience.

The goal of this project is to serve as a newsletter,
showcasing the exciting intersection of systems programming and biological data
in the context of Rust.
Whether you're a researcher, developer, student, or just bio-curious, this site
aims to highlight how the Rust ecosystem is evolving to meet the complex demands
of modern bioinformatics.

Each month, you'll find:

- **Spotlights** on both popular and emerging Rust bioinformatics tools and libraries
- **Challenges** to test your skills
- **Research paper summaries** and analyses

Stay tuned, stay curious, and watch the impacts of Rust on bioinformatics.
